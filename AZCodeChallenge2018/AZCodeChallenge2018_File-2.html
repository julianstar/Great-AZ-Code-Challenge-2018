	Hello, and welcome to my project for the Great AZ Code Challenge 2018. I assume that you've gone through the website. You might wonder why it's essentally a game. That's because that's pretty much all I know how to code. I know a little html, I learned some CSS, although I've since forgotten all of it, so most of what I know is JavaScript, and the idea that came to me was, at its heart, a game. I hope you like it! Thank you for reading! Now, on to the code!

Here's how it works: After reading this and clicking the buitton at the bottom of the page, you'll be taken to a list of skills to help you be more effective, when you click one, you'll be given a quick lesson on that skill, and some references for more reading. After that there will be a quick interactive scenario where your knowledge of and abilty to practice your new skill will be tested. You get points(called coins) for completing a secnario. Have fun!", 30, "black");
