	Hello, and welcome to my project for the Great AZ Code Challenge 2018. I assume that you've gone through the website. You might wonder why it's essentally a game. That's because that's pretty much all I know how to code. I know a little html, I learned some CSS, although I've since forgotten all of it, so most of what I know is JavaScript, and the idea that came to me was, at its heart, a game. I hope you like it! Thank you for reading! Now, on to the code!

	/*
	Just a note before we begin, I orginally thought that this mini-game would be draging and droping items on a list, and trying to put them in the correct order. After thinking up some ideas of how that would work, I decided that it would be hard and boring. So I went for this because it's quick for me and the player, and I think, a little more fun than odering a list, which is proably what one of the other games is going to be about.
