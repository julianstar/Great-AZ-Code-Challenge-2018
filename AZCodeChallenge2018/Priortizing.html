	Hello, and welcome to my project for the Great AZ Code Challenge 2018. I assume that you've gone through the website. You might wonder why it's essentally a game. That's because that's pretty much all I know how to code. I know a little html, I learned some CSS, although I've since forgotten all of it, so most of what I know is JavaScript, and the idea that came to me was, at its heart, a game. I hope you like it! Thank you for reading! Now, on to the code!

Let's look at a list of tasks like this one: 1-Mop Floors, 2-Vacum Floors 3-Finish paper which is due tomorrow 4- Watch the latest episode of new TV show 5-Get that a cough checked out. Working on that list in that order probably won't end well. By the time you've mopped and vacuumed the floors, you'll barely have time to finish your paper, and even if you manage that, you probably won't manage to get that cough checked out. What we need is to prioritize this list.", 20, "white");

If you really want to get it done, you could take your writing device(s) to the doctor's, and write in the waiting room. You could switch the mopping and vacuuming of the floors, but apart from that, that's probably the best order to do it in.", 20, "white");
