	Hello, and welcome to my project for the Great AZ Code Challenge 2018. I assume that you've gone through the website. You might wonder why it's essentally a game. That's because that's pretty much all I know how to code. I know a little html, I learned some CSS, although I've since forgotten all of it, so most of what I know is JavaScript, and the idea that came to me was, at its heart, a game. I hope you like it! Thank you for reading! Now, on to the code!

Be realistic about your time you can't get 20 2 hour tasks done in 1 day. Nor, most likely 2 days. Make a schedule of some of the things on your to-do list to do now, and start working your way through that to-do list. Make sure to prioritize your schedule, don't put the un-important things on there first, start with the important things. But that's in the lesson on prioritizing. ");

Also, as for what sort of tasks, it's whatever tasks you have to do.")
