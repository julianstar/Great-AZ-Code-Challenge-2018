# Great-AZ-Code-Challenge-2018




	Hello, and welcome to my project for the Great AZ Code Challenge 2018. I assume that you've gone through the website. You might wonder why it's essentally a game. That's because that's pretty much all I know how to code. I know a little html, I learned some CSS, although I've since forgotten all of it, so most of what I know is JavaScript, and the idea that came to me was, at its heart, a game. I hope you like it! Thank you for reading! Now, on to the code!

	A few notes:
	#1. = Typos in the file names. All of the text has been through a  spellchecker, however file names have not. I apologize for any typos in the file names.
	#2. = Known bugs. == 1. In the ignoring distractions, the first distraction, if you choose to ingore it, you'll get a curly bracket next to the coin value. I haven't seen a way to fix that and it goes away next time you get coins.
	#3. = There are some string... somethings in the ignoring distractions code. Those were meant to help fix a bug. I think some of them aren't helping, but I don't know, so I'm not going to take them out. 
	I hope you all like it! Thank you for judging!
